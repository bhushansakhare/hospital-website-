    <h1>LABORATORY</h1>
    <p>Laboratory experiences as a part of most U.S. high school science curricula have been taken for granted for
        decades, but they have rarely been carefully examined. What do they contribute to science learning? What can
        they contribute to science learning? What is the current status of labs in our nationï¿½s high schools as a
        context for learning science? This book looks at a range of questions about how laboratory experiences fit into
        U.S. high schools:

        What is effective laboratory teaching?
        What does research tell us about learning in high school science labs?
        How should student learning in laboratory experiences be assessed?
        Do all student have access to laboratory experiences?
        What changes need to be made to improve laboratory experiences for high school students?
        How can school organization contribute to effective laboratory teaching?
        With increased attention to the U.S. education system and student outcomes, no part of the high school
        curriculum should escape scrutiny. This timely book investigates factors that influence a high school laboratory
        experience, looking closely at what currently takes place and what the goals of those experiences are and should
        be. Science educators, school administrators, policy makers, and parents will all benefit from a better
        understanding of the need for laboratory experiences to be an integral part of the science curriculum—and how
        that can be accomplished.

        The organisation and contents of laboratories are determined by the differing requirements of the specialists working within. A physics laboratory might contain a particle accelerator or vacuum chamber, while a metallurgy laboratory could have apparatus for casting or refining metals or for testing their strength. A chemist or biologist might use a wet laboratory, while a psychologist's laboratory might be a room with one-way mirrors and hidden cameras in which to observe behavior. In some laboratories, such as those commonly used by computer scientists, computers (sometimes supercomputers) are used for either simulations or the analysis of data. Scientists in other fields will still use other types of laboratories. Engineers use laboratories as well to design, build, and test technological devices.

        Scientific laboratories can be found as research room and learning spaces in schools and universities, industry, government, or military facilities, and even aboard ships and spacecraft.

        Despite the underlying notion of the lab as a confined space for experts,[2] the term "laboratory" is also increasingly applied to workshop spaces such as Living Labs, Fab Labs, or Hackerspaces, in which people meet to work on societal problems or make prototypes, working collaboratively or sharing resources.[3][4][5] This development is inspired by new, participatory approaches to science and innovation and relies on user-centred design methods[6] and concepts like Open innovation or User innovation,.[7][8] One distinctive feature of work in Open Labs is the phenomenon of translation, driven by the different backgrounds and levels of expertise of the people involved.[9]</p>
