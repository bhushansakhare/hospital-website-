    <h2>Vaccines reduce risks of getting a disease by working with your body’s natural defenses to build protection.
        When you get a vaccine, your immune system responds. It:

        Recognizes the invading germ, such as the virus or bacteria.

        Produces antibodies. Antibodies are proteins produced naturally by the immune system to fight disease.

        Remembers the disease and how to fight it. If you are then exposed to the germ in the future, your immune system
        can quickly destroy it before you become unwell.

        The vaccine is therefore a safe and clever way to produce an immune response in the body, without causing
        illness.

        Our immune systems are designed to remember. Once exposed to one or more doses of a vaccine, we typically remain
        protected against a disease for years, decades or even a lifetime. This is what makes vaccines so effective.
        Rather than treating a disease after it occurs, vaccines prevent us in the first instance from getting sick.
